# Atlas of Opportunity

The **Atlas of Opportunities** (Atlas de Oportunidades, in Portuguese) is a free decision-support website aimed at helping entrepreneurs and companies to identify business opportunities. The project combines multiple data sources, processed with spatial data science and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. 

The **Atlas of Opportunities - Brazil** is coordenated by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), which is part of a collaborative international research network enabled by principal partner Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), together with Sabanci University (Turkey), University of Bologna and Bocconi University (Italy), and the Brazilian institutions Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), and Universidade de Brasília (UnB). The project started with a [South Australia version](https://github.com/CxSci/SA-dashboard), and is growing to other countries or areas, such as the [Colchester (NY-USA)](https://mtb.mit.edu/explore/rochester#map=9.6/43.1556/-77.685). This repository details the development of the Brazilian Atlas of Opportunities.
